Hi there! It looks like you've stumbled across the 8base tutorials repository. To keep things organized, we like to keep a Markdown version of every tutorials - along with any sample apps/code - in its own subfolder of this directory. That way, we're never spending time chasing down lost/forgotten GitHub repos when an update must be made.
 
At the end of the day, the web is the wild-digital-west. Especially when it comes to content! Things get published, copied, edited, shared, and re-published across multiple platforms at mind-boggling speeds. It's pretty much impossible for anyone to keep up.

So, we will always do our best to make sure that the tutorials stored here stay up-to-date and awesome! If you've come across an issue or error in one of these tutorials on another platform, please let us know! However, always double check whether or not the update version has been published in this repo.

## Contributing to 8base Tutorials 
Like most great things, 8base and its tutorials are a work in progress. As a consequence of that, we're constantly improving things and in need of some TLC. Right now, we have several team members writing/maintaining the tutorials, and frankly, they could use a little help...

That's where YOU come in; ðŸŽ‰ **8base's awesome future contributor** ðŸŽ‰

Our tutorials are public and open-sourced [right here](https://github.com/8base/tutorials) on GitHub. So whenever you want to, you could:

* Submit pull requests: Want to not only point out the problem but be apart of the solution? Clone the Tutorials repo and submit pull requests start... pretty much anything, like:
	* Grammar and spelling
	* Errors in any code example
	* Even BETTER code examples
	* Poorly written sections
	* Better descriptions
	* A nice GIF
	* Anything else...

If you need help getting started, just reach out to us at [support@8base.com](mailto:support@8base.com). However, here are some more complete descriptions of work that can be done.

### 1. Reporting an Issue
8base uses GitHub Issue Tracking to track issues (primarily bugs and contributions of new code). If you've found a bug in 8base, this is the place to start. You'll need to create a (free) GitHub account in order to submit an issue, to comment on them or to create pull requests.

### 2. Create an Awesome Code Example
Examples are sooo important in great documentation and are very helpful for the 8base community. You can help by providing complete code examples, or by editing the current ones. Honestly, if you think "a, b, and c examples are terrible and I could make them better", please do! We won't take it personally...

### 3. Contributing Articles
You can help improve the 8base Tutorials by making them more coherent, consistent, or readable and adding missing information, correcting factual errors, fixing typos, and bringing them up to date with the latest 8base features. It's honestly an open-book. If you think something is useful, others probably will too.
